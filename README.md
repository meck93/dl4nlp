# Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing

Master course at the University of Zurich (HS18)

## Content

This repository contains all exercises (including description and code) and the summary of the lecture (including a book summary of Goldberg: _Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing_).

The summary folder contains :

- [summary.md](summary/summary.md) (main file with all content written in Markdown)

- summary.html (html file created from Markdown)

- [summary.pdf](summary/summary.pdf) (pdf file created from html file) => **best presentation** apart from Markdown itself.
