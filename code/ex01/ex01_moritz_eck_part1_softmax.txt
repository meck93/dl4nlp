Compare the output of the SVC and the SMC: 
- Difference? 

- What additional information do we get from the SMC?
The advantage with the SMC over the SVC is that the SVC performs a hard classification and assign a discrete label wheras the output of the SMC is a probabilty (since it uses the softmax function). Even though the probaility is turned into a hard classification to assign a label to the instance during the computation the probability output of the SMC is used.
