Reason for the highest scoring result:


What is the advantage of grid search cross validation?
The advantage of cross validation is that the result of the classifier is valid not only on 1 specific train/test split but on n-Folds. 
This is beneficial since the 1-split might be a too optimistic or pestimistic result. 
Cross validation ensures that every fold (e.g. in 5-fold) is used a validation set once and otherwise as training set. The results of the classifier are average across all five folds. 

The benefit of using grid search is that a combination of parameters can be evaluated automatically. Otherwise the developer would have to manually change the parameters and check if the results improves or not. 
GridSearch evaluates automatically different parameters by changing them and retraining the classifier. GridSearch will keep the best result i.e. the parameters producing the best scoring classifier. 

The combination of GridSearch and CrossValidation allows to obtain a more realistic result. 
If GridSearch was performed on a single split setting (same train/test split) then the classifier might be adjusted too much for this setting. One could say it would overfit to this specific split.
